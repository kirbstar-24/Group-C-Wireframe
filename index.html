    <p>The Nintendo Switch is a unique device that allows users to game on their television at home or wherever they go with a nearly seamless system. In addition, the pair of Joy-Cons can be paired together with the grip, attached to the Switch console to play in handheld mode, or used individually to allow for easy multi-player experiences. The console comes with everything needed for a fast set-up to use it in its handheld mode or connect it to any monitor or television screen that uses HDMI, a power adapter to plug into the Console itself or the Dock, and the tools to comfortably use the included Joy-Cons in any setup the user desires.</p>

  <h2>User Guide</h2>
  <h3>First-Time Setup</h3>
  <p>To begin, plug the included AC adapter into a wall outlet and plug the end with an oval-shaped USB-C connector into the port on the bottom of the console.</p>
  <p>The initial setup process can also be completed in docked mode by:
  <br>connecting the AC adapter and HDMI cable into the appropriate ports on the back of the dock
  <br>connecting the other end of the HDMI cable into the desired screen
  <br>placing the console into the dock as seen on the box</p>
  <p>Slide the left and right Joy-Con controllers into the corresponding slots on the console.</p>
  <p>Once you turn the console on for the first time, configure basic settings such as:
  <ul>Language and region</ul>
  <ul>Internet</ul>
  <ul>Time zone</ul>
  </p>
  <p>Connect the console to a TV or monitor. This can be done by:
  <br>Connecting the AC adapter and HDMI cable into the appropriate ports on the back of the dock

  </p>
  <p>Create a user profile. This involves setting a nickname and character icon. This can be done for multiple users during the startup process, but users can also be added at any time through the system settings.</p>
  <p>Creating a new Nintendo Account or logging into an existing one is also part of this process. If a new one needs to be created, the system will ask the user to enter an email address to send the account creation instructions to.</p>
  <p>To expedite this process, an account can also be created by going to Nintendo.com and creating a new account prior to setting up the console.</p>
  <p>Press the “home” button on the right controller to complete the console setup.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
  <h3>I have my console set up, now what about the games?</h3>
  <p>Games can be added to your console library in two ways: Physically via a game cartridge or digitally via a download from the eShop.</p>
  <p>To use a game cartridge, flip open the cover on the top right corner of the console, remove the cartridge from its case, and push it into the slot into the console until a “click” is heard.</p>
  <p>To access the eShop and purchase digital software, navigate to the button on the bottom of the screen marked with a red shopping bag. Sign in with the desired user account, and browse to find a game to purchase. Once the payment has been processed, a new icon will appear on the home screen and the download will start.</p>
  <h3>Can I use controllers that are not Joy-Cons with the console?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Other controllers can be connected to the console via Bluetooth or USB.</p>
  <h3>How do I connect Bluetooth devices to the console?</h3>
  <p>For controllers, navigate to the “Change Grip/Order” menu from the controller settings at the bottom of the screen. While in this menu, press the button on the controller to pair Bluetooth, and the controller will appear onscreen once it has been paired.</p>
  <p>For audio devices such as speakers or headphones, navigate to the system settings and select “Bluetooth Audio.” From there, select “pair device” and pair the device you would like to use.</p>
