    <p>The Nintendo Switch is a unique device that allows users to game on their television at home or wherever they go with a nearly seamless system. In addition, the pair of Joy-Cons can be paired together with the grip, attached to the Switch console to play in handheld mode, or used individually to allow for easy multi-player experiences. The console comes with everything needed for a fast set-up to use it in its handheld mode or connect it to any monitor or television screen that uses HDMI, a power adapter to plug into the Console itself or the Dock, and the tools to comfortably use the included Joy-Cons in any setup the user desires.</p>
